# AWS Configuration File
# This file contains AWS CLI configuration settings which control how AWS CLI commands interact with AWS services.
# AWS CLI configuration uses an INI file format with sections (marked by [section-name]) containing key-value pairs.

[default]
# The AWS region to send requests to by default (eu-west-1 corresponds to Ireland)
region = eu-west-1
# The output format for AWS CLI commands (options include json, yaml, text, table)
output = json
# References the named SSO session configuration to use for authentication
# sso_session = rfc
# The AWS account ID to use when assuming a role via SSO
sso_account_id = 736805434667
# The IAM role to assume in the specified account via SSO
sso_role_name = AdministratorAccess
# The URL to initiate AWS SSO authentication
sso_start_url = https://d-90679b79c1.awsapps.com/start#/
# The AWS region where the SSO directory is hosted
sso_region = us-east-1
# OAuth scopes requested during device authorization
sso_registration_scopes = sso:account:access

# Usage:
# 1. Authentication: Run `aws sso login` to authenticate via SSO
# 2. Using the Configuration: All AWS CLI commands will use these settings by default
# 3. Multiple Profiles: Add additional profiles using [profile profile-name] sections
# 4. Temporary Credentials: SSO credentials are cached locally and refreshed as needed
